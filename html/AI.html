            <p class="project-description">
                BERT is a deep learning model, specifically a pre-trained natural language processing (NLP) model based on the Transformer architecture. By fine-tuning the classifier layer of BERT on the Chinese and English datasets of sentiment classification to adapt to the task of sentiment analysis, a terminal interactive script is written to call the fine-tuned trained BERT model, so that the emotional state of the sentence can be returned when a sentence is input in the terminal. The details will be explained in the blog.

            <p class="project-description">
                In this experiment, the optical disc was processed through a series of processes such as grayscale conversion and image enhancement, and then the improved Canny algorithm was used for feature recognition, and then the circularity of the defective part was calculated to determine the defect. A GUI was designed to import images and perform the above operations, and finally 50 workpiece images were used for detection to obtain the accuracy.

                <h2 class="project-title"> MATLAB App Designer-based Electronic Yangqin Simulator </h2>
                <p class="project-description">
                    This experiment mainly involves sound signal processing. The original yangqin sound is analyzed through FFT transformation, and three methods, namely FIR low-pass filtering, median filtering and wavelet noise reduction, are compared. Finally, FIR low-pass filtering is selected as the best noise reduction solution. The second is application development. An interactive interface with three modules, namely teaching demonstration, electronic yangqin performance and music score selection, is designed. Through callback functions, functions such as animation teaching, performance simulation and music score playback are realized, which digitizes the learning and performance of the traditional yangqin instrument.
