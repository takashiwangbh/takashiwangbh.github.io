            <p>
                I am from Guizhou Province, China. I studied in Tianjin, China for university and in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan for graduate studies. My main research direction is emotional rendering. In professional courses, I learned a lot of computer knowledge, including programming, computer networks, deep learning, VR and AR, etc. I also learned some art-related knowledge, including animation, video shooting, graphic design, etc. I love learning, but there is really no end to all kinds of knowledge, so I am very busy most of the time. In addition to these professional courses, I used to work in a TV station, running around the front line of the city to interview and edit into news, so I am familiar with the workflow of news. I also play many kinds of musical instruments, including piano, violin, saxophone, guitar, harmonica, etc. I have been learning music since I was a child. I think the emotion of music is more important than the skills. Of course, I also like taking pictures. I will take a picture before every meal. I have traveled to many places in China and Japan. Every time I go to a place, I will take a lot of photos. I like to record the little moments in life. I also like skateboarding. I have suffered many injuries of different sizes during skateboarding, but it is in the pain that I have completed those impossible challenges. I used to be a skateboard coach.
