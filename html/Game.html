                        "CODEBUG" is a puzzle game with the theme of bugs and only uses circles, rectangles and triangles. The interface is similar to the software VS Code often used by programmers. Players solve bugs by finding patterns. In the game, players can hear a nice song at each level, and the small triangle blocks below will dance to the music.

Players need to use high-tech drones to build a path for the kitten to move forward, cross ruins and dangerous places, and find hope. The game combines wasteland and future technology styles. The dynamic platform creation mechanism challenges the player's strategy and operation. The narrative and music render a warm journey across despair and hope.

                I recreated an old and classic 2D level-breaking game by myself. The game has three levels, and each level is increasingly difficult. There will be more and more monsters, and more and more diamonds to pick up.

                        I used AR technology and Adobe InDesign's e-book editor to create a software that allows users to interact with the corresponding models by simply scanning the pictures in the books. This allows users to understand ancient Chinese architecture in a more vivid way.
